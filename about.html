      <h3>Hello, I'm Mary</h3>
      <p style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Times New Roman">
        I am a resilient, hardworking, and determined individual with a degree
        in Biochemistry. My journey in the world of technology and software
        engineering began with a deep-seated passion for using programming to
        solve healthcare-associated problems. Currently, I am focused on
        mastering JavaScript, but I have already gained proficiency in a variety
        of programming languages and tools, including CSS, HTML, C, Python,
        MySQL, and DevOps. <br />I am enthusiastic about the intersection of
        healthcare and technology, and I believe that software engineering can
        play a pivotal role in improving healthcare services and outcomes. I am
        excited about the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead in the
        health tech field. <br />In my free time, I enjoy contributing to
        open-source projects, reading tech blogs, and keeping up with the latest
        developments in the healthcare and software engineering domains. I'm
        also an advocate for lifelong learning and self-improvement, always
        seeking to expand my skillset and knowledge.
