<h1>The Best Movies According to Mary</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<h3>Nowhere</h3>
<p>
  This is such a great movie! Storyline is attempting to survive in the middle
  of nowhere
</p>
<h3>Love is Blind</h3>
<p>
  Well, is there a life with no love stories? <br />I love the suspense it
  creates even for the casts and seeing their happy ending is inspiring
</p>
<h3>Smurfs</h3>
<p>
  Love watching cute animations and this has to be the best since my childhood
  days!
